# Hello world

```rust
fn main() {

}
```
- Functions are defined with the `fn` keyword.
- program execution starts in main

```rust
fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
}
```
- Rust style is to indent with four spaces, not a tab.
- The `println!` macro is used to print to the console.
- using a `!` means that youâ€™re calling a macro instead of a normal function.
