# Basic rust projects
I'm currently learning rust through the [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) book.
This repo contains some basic examples of rust code. You can go through each numbered directory, and look at the README.md file in each directory to understand rust.

Might update the repo and add more basic projects in the future, if I go through something else.
